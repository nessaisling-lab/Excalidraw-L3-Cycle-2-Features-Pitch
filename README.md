# Excalidraw L3 Cycle 2 — Features Pitch (Group G1)

Pursuit L3, Cycle 2. Client: **Carlos Godoy, Head of Product**. KPI under discussion: activation rate — new signups who complete and save a first drawing within their first session.

This is a prototype workspace, **not a fork** and not aimed at upstream PRs. `main` is the shared base, held at upstream `excalidraw/excalidraw@afa3a653` with full history (`git blame` and `git log -S` work). Nobody works on `main`.

| Branch | Person | GitHub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aisling` | Aisling Leiva-Davila (owner) | [@nessaisling-lab](https://github.com/nessaisling-lab) |
| `cornell` | Cornell Robertson | [@CodeToTheCore](https://github.com/CodeToTheCore) |
| `jill` | Jillian Krebsbach | [@JillK83](https://github.com/JillK83) |
| `lawrence` | Lawrence Carrillo | [@lawrencecarrillo](https://github.com/lawrencecarrillo) |

## Setup

Needs Node 18 or newer (tested on Node 24) and Yarn 1.22.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nessaisling-lab/Excalidraw-L3-Cycle-2-Features-Pitch.git
cd Excalidraw-L3-Cycle-2-Features-Pitch
git checkout <your-branch>   # aisling, cornell, jill or lawrence
yarn install
yarn start                   # opens on http://localhost:3001
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `yarn start` | Dev server on port 3001 |
| `yarn test:typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `yarn test:app --watch=false` | Run the test suite once, without touching snapshots |
| `yarn fix` | Auto-format and lint. Run it before committing — there is no pre-commit hook |

## Workflow

- Work on your own branch. Nobody commits to `main` directly.
- Pull in team changes with `git merge main`.
- Open PRs into `main` for team review.

## Gotchas

- **Port is 3001, not 3000.** It is set in `.env.development`.
- **`yarn test:update` rewrites snapshots.** Only use it when you mean to.
- **Never run `git clean -fd` in this repo.** `node_modules/@excalidraw/*` are symlinks back into `packages/`, and a recursive delete follows them and deletes real source.
- **A few tests can time out on a busy machine**, for example while the dev server is starting. Rerun the failing file on its own before assuming it is broken.
- **Don't click "Save to Excalidraw+" when running locally.** In dev it uploads the encrypted scene to Excalidraw's own Firebase dev project (`excalidraw-oss-dev`), not ours, then opens `localhost:3000/import`, which doesn't exist. Excalidraw+ is closed-source, so that page is not in this repo. Leave this path alone until the team adds a local stand-in.

## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.
